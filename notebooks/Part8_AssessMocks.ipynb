    "There are 100 models per Fi, stepping down from 250 to 100 uJy in 10 uJy steps.  Eaching injection had a fixed ri = 0.08 arcseconds, and a random azi.  I recommend starting by assessing what fraction of cases in each Fi bin did we successfully recover?  Meaning, for how many cases out of 100 did we find roughly the right Fo, ro, and azo?  You'll have to decide what tolerance in each of those parameters you think we should accept as \"successful\"...this might take some experimentation.  You might consider plotting the injected versus recovered values of each parameter also, etc. etc.  We can discuss your findings on Thursday."
